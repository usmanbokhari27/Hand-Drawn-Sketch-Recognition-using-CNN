Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning that
leverages pre-trained models to solve new tasks with limited data. In this project,
we explored transfer learning for image classification using various pre-trained
models such as ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG16, and ultimately achieved the best
results with the VGG19 model. This report outlines our methodology, the models
used, and the results obtained.
Methodology:
1. Data Preparation: We started by preparing our dataset, which consists of
images categorized into 250 classes. We used Pandas to load the training
and validation data from CSV files and prepared them for training.
2. Transfer Learning Models: We experimented with several pre-trained
models available in Keras, including ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG16, and VGG19.
These models were initialized with pre-trained weights on ImageNet and
then fine-tuned for our specific classification task.
3. Model Architecture: The VGG19 model, known for its deep architecture,
was chosen as our final model due to its superior performance in terms of
accuracy and convergence speed during training. The model includes
convolutional layers, pooling layers, global average pooling, batch
normalization, dropout, and dense layers with softmax activation for multiclass classification.
4. Training: We trained the VGG19 model using a data generator with data
augmentation for the training set. The model was compiled with the Adam
optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the
evaluation metric.
Results: After training the VGG19 model for 25 epochs, we observed significant
improvements in both training and validation metrics. The model achieved an
accuracy of 74% on the training set and 49% on the validation set, indicating good
generalization capabilities.
Conclusion: In conclusion, transfer learning using the VGG19 model proved to be
highly effective for our image classification task. By leveraging the knowledge
learned from ImageNet, the model demonstrated strong performance even with
limited training data. The use of techniques such as data augmentation, batch
normalization, dropout, and fine-tuning contributed to the model's robustness and
accuracy.
Recommendations and Future Work: For future work, we recommend exploring
additional techniques such as ensemble learning, hyperparameter tuning, and
model distillation to further improve the model's performance. Additionally,
investigating different architectures or combining multiple pre-trained models
could lead to even better results but due to lack of computational resources we
could not try them all.
